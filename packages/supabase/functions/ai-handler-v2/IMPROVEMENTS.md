# AI Assistant Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the AI assistant to address issues identified during testing.

## 1. Recipe Search Enhancement

### Problem
Users couldn't find their saved recipes when using slightly different wording (e.g., "morning smoothie" vs "breakfast smoothie").

### Solution
Implemented a comprehensive fuzzy recipe search algorithm with:

- Multiple string similarity algorithms working together:
  - Levenshtein distance for handling typos and misspellings
  - Jaccard similarity for word overlap
  - Token containment for partial matches
  
- Synonym handling for common food terms:
  - Time of day: breakfast ↔ morning, lunch ↔ midday, dinner ↔ evening
  - Food types: smoothie ↔ shake, salad ↔ bowl, soup ↔ broth
  - Common ingredients: chicken ↔ poultry, etc.

- Description text search:
  - Falls back to searching recipe descriptions when names don't match
  - Allows finding recipes by ingredients

### Files Changed
- `utils/stringMatcher.ts` - Core string similarity algorithms
- `utils/recipeSearch.ts` - Recipe search service using fuzzy matching
- `tools/execution.ts` - Updated executeFindSavedRecipeByName to use fuzzy search

## 2. Recipe Name Improvement

### Problem
The AI would use generic names for recipes (e.g., "Custom Recipe") rather than intelligently deriving appropriate names from user input and ingredients.

### Solution
Created a comprehensive recipe name extractor that:

- Prioritizes explicit naming by users (e.g., "call it X", "name it Y")
- Derives meaningful names from ingredients by identifying key items
- Extracts relevant food types from user messages
- Formats names consistently with proper capitalization

### Files Changed
- `utils/recipeNameExtractor.ts` - Recipe name extraction utilities
- `tools/execution.ts` - Updated executeAnalyzeRecipeIngredients to use better names

## 3. Confirmation Flow Standardization

### Problem
The AI assistant had inconsistent confirmation flows across different actions, confusing users.

### Solution
Implemented a standardized confirmation policy system that:

- Defines clear rules for when confirmations are required
- Creates consistent messaging for confirmations
- Avoids unnecessary confirmations for high-confidence actions
- Always confirms high-impact actions like deletions

### Files Changed
- `utils/confirmationPolicy.ts` - Standardized confirmation handling
- `tools/execution.ts` - Updated executeLogPremadeFood to use new policy
- `index.ts` - Added a new recipe name confirmation handler

## 4. Testing Framework

Created a simple testing framework to verify our improvements:

- `tests/recipeSearch.test.ts` - Tests for recipe search functionality
- `tests/run_tests.sh` - Script to run the tests

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Undo Functionality Redesign**
   - Create a comprehensive action tracking system
   - Implement proper undo operations for all actions

2. **Implement Compound Request Handling**
   - Create a request parser to handle multiple actions in one message
   - Implement sequential execution of multiple actions
