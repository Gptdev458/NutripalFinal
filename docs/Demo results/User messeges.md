2. Lemon-Dill Mediterranean Chicken Soup (with Fennel, Basil, Vegan Yogurt & Spinach)
This soup is bright and creamy, with lemon, fresh herbs, and the added nutrients of spinach.
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon high oleic safflower oil
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 yellow onion, diced
1 small fennel bulb, thinly sliced (use both bulb and fronds for garnish)
2 large carrots, thinly sliced
6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
3 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
2 teaspoons fresh dill, chopped
1 teaspoon fresh basil, chopped (or ½ teaspoon dried)
Zest and juice of 1 lemon
1 cup pearl couscous
⅔ cup frozen peas (required!)
1 cup fresh spinach, roughly chopped
⅓ cup unsweetened vegan yogurt (for a creamy, tangy finish)  (let’s leave this out but I’ll put it in when I eat the soup)
Instructions:
Sauté Aromatics – Heat safflower oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, fennel, and carrots. Sauté for 4–5 minutes until fragrant and softened.
Simmer the Broth – Pour in the chicken broth, add the chicken thighs and salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.
Shred the Chicken – Remove chicken, shred with two forks, and return it to the pot.
Cook the Couscous – Stir in the pearl couscous and let cook for 10 minutes until tender.
Add Peas & Spinach – Stir in the frozen peas and chopped spinach. Let cook for 2 minutes until wilted.
Finish with Herbs & Yogurt – Stir in the fresh dill, basil, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Whisk in the vegan yogurt for a creamy texture.
Serve & Enjoy – Ladle into bowls and garnish with fennel fronds for a fresh finish.
